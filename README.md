# Advent of Code

Each day contains four files; `1.js` and `2.js` for the two tasks for the day, `test` for example data, and `data` for the actual input.
Run the code with `node -r esm n.js` where `n` is 1 or 2.

Helper functions exist in `helpers/index.js` 

Days are initialised using `template.js`

## Run the code

```
cd 01
../run 1.js
```
